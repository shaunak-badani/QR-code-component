1. How to adjust font responsively?
2. Default mode to center a div : (2 quick ways I know of) 
    a. position absolute, translate(-50, -50) trick
    b. margin auto 
    Anything I should be careful about while using these?

3. Don't think responsively, I just start making the design from the image (desktop view)
 and then make changes as I feel fit. Have trouble when need to change to responsive layout.

4. Need to work on class naming convention

5. How to fill up a section as one height of a monitor using css? I used (height: 99vh, width: 99vw), 
probably not advised.
